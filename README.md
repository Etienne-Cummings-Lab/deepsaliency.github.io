Website for the EFRI BRAID project. The object of the project is to use the biologically plausible [proto-object saliency](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.visres.2013.10.005) for sparsifying connectivity in Deep Neural Networks to ultimately obtain parsimonious yet efficient training and inference compute.
